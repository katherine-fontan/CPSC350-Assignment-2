//This program runs the game of life module giving the user a choice of input and output styles and modes

This program was coded in collaboration between Katherine and Krystal, both agree that we had equal participation as we met outside of classroom to work on it. The commits may not reflect each of the people's work as we were sometimes together working on one computer or facetiming.

GAME MODES THAT WORK:
-Classic
-Mirror
-Donut

WHAT WE DIDN'T GET TO:
The enter key is not integrated in our program nor is the pause button. The stability of the game is a little off. On Classic mode it stabilizes and stops but there might be a double print. (for example, I generated a 10x10 board with a density of .5 and stability ended on generation 37 even thought there were still cells that were alive).

Help: Michael(SI) + Sabelle, Matt, and Daniel from the tutoring center also provided some advice on how to understand the game and fix some bumps along the way.


To run: there is a makefile, however we ran our program using g++ *.cpp && ./a.out
