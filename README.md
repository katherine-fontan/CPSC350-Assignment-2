//This program runs the game of life module giving the user a choice of input and output styles and modes

This program was coded in collaboration between Katherine and Krystal, both agree that we had equal participation as we met outside of classroom to work on it. The commits may not reflect an accurate representation of each person's contributions as we sometimes worked on it together while using one computer or facetiming.

GAME MODES THAT WORK:
-Classic
-Mirror
-Donut

WHAT WE DIDN'T GET TO:
The brief pause between generations through the "enter" key or output to a file is not integrated in our program. The generations stop generating once stability is reached or the world becomes empty. When this is reached, the stable/empty generation is printed twice.

HELP: Michael(SI) + Sabelle, Matt, and Daniel from the tutoring center also provided some advice on how to understand the game and fix some bugs along the way.

To run: there is a makefile, however we ran our program using g++ *.cpp && ./a.out
