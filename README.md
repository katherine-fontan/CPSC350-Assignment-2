//This program runs the game of life module giving the user a choice of input and output styles and modes

This program was coded in collaboration between Katherine and Krystal, both agree that we had equal participation as we met outside of classroom so work on it. The commits may not reflect each of the people's work as we were sometimes together working on one computer or facetiming.

GAME MODES THAT WORK:
-Classic
-Mirror

WHAT WE DIDN'T GET TO:
The enter key is not integrated in our program nor is the pause button. We decided to just run the generation for a specific amount of loops (30). This number was decided based on the test.txt file Michael(SI) provided and that was the amount of loops it took for classic to stabilize.

Help: Michael(SI) + Sabelle, Matt, and Daniel from the tutoring center also provided some advice on how to understand the game and fix some bumps along the way.


To run: there is a makefile, however we ran our program using g++ *.cpp && ./a.out
