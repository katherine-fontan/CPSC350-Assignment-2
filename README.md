//This program runs the game of life module giving the user a choice of input and output styles and modes

This program was coded in collaboration between Katherine and Krystal, both agree that we had equal participation as we met outside of classroom so work on it. The commits may not reflect each of the people's work as we were sometimes together working on one computer.

Errors:


We did not get around to complete donut and mirror mode as we were having problems with our classic run, so we decided to focus our attention into fixing that problem first.

To run: there is a makefile, however we ran our program using g++ *.cpp && ./a.out
